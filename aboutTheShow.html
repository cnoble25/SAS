                  Whether on the Greenway-Rise Campus or the Belfield Campus: 
                  WELCOME to the 2023-24 St. Anne’s-Belfield School All-School 
                  Student Art Show!<br><br>
                  This exhibition represents every single K-12 student who has 
                  enrolled in a Visual Arts course for the academic year.  The range 
                  and breadth of creative production is a testament to the dedication 
                  of our students and teachers alike; the exhibition is an illustrated
                  record of a wonderful year in the Visual Arts!<br><br>

                  The overall volume of art totals a dizzying 981 pieces. 
                   In an effort to help visitors locate their favorite painting, sculpture, 
                   photograph, drawing, or mixed media creation, a QR Code is 
                   available at the bottom of this poster.  Buildings showcase work 
                   from all grades and the app will first inform you of whether you’re
                    at the correct campus and from there an exact location is provided 
                    based on the proximity to classroom numbers.<br><br>
                  
                  Each adorned wall presents as a life-before-your-eyes moment; 
                  you may view a Kindergartener’s mixed-media to your left, a senior’s 
                  thesis example to your right, and any range of grade in 
                  between them. The creative thread is evident from one to the next 
                  and is emblematic of students’ diverse lives.  The artworks by St. Anne’s-Belfield
                   students is an amazing collection of shared but 
                   different eyes on the world.<br><br>
                  
                  
                  Thank you for visiting and spending time with the students and their work!<br><br>
