                  Whether on the Greenway-Rise Campus or the Belfield Campus: <br>
                  WELCOME to the 2023-24 St. Anne’s-Belfield School All-School <br>
                  Student Art Show!<br><br>
                  This exhibition represents every single K-12 student who has <br>
                  enrolled in a Visual Arts course for the academic year.  The range <br>
                  and breadth of creative production is a testament to the dedication <br>
                  of our students and teachers alike; the exhibition is an illustrated<br>
                  record of a wonderful year in the Visual Arts!<br><br>

                  The overall volume of art totals a dizzying 981 pieces. <br>
                   In an effort to help visitors locate their favorite painting, sculpture, <br>
                   photograph, drawing, or mixed media creation, a QR Code is <br>
                   available at the bottom of this poster.  Buildings showcase work <br>
                   from all grades and the app will first inform you of whether you’re<br>
                    at the correct campus and from there an exact location is provided <br>
                    based on the proximity to classroom numbers.<br><br>
                  
                  Each adorned wall presents as a life-before-your-eyes moment; <br>
                  you may view a Kindergartener’s mixed-media to your left, a senior’s <br>
                  thesis example to your right, and any range of grade in <br>
                  between them. The creative thread is evident from one to the next <br>
                  and is emblematic of students’ diverse lives.  The artworks by St. Anne’s-Belfield<br>
                   students is an amazing collection of shared but <br>
                   different eyes on the world.<br><br>
                  
                  
                  Thank you for visiting and spending time with the students and their work!<br><br>
